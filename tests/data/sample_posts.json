Analysts hadn’t expected the $1 billion revenue benchmark from the Denver-based company until the fourth quarter of this year.\n\n“The growth rate of our business has accelerated radically, after years of investment on our part and derision by some,” wrote CEO Alex Karp in a letter to shareholders. “The skeptics are admittedly fewer now, having been defanged and bent into a kind of submission.”\n\nThe software analytics company also boosted its full-year outlook guidance. For the full year, Palantir now expects revenues to range between $4.142 billion and $4.150 billion, up from prior guidance of $3.89 billion to $3.90 billion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/04/palantir-pltr-q2-earnings-2025.html",

    "content": "https://imgur.com/a/j3vlh6q\n\nIronically, commenters should have listened to the quote they were attempting to mock - be greedy when others are fearful. \n\nWhen the tariff fears were at their peak in April and market was down 16% YTD, I couldn’t believe the comments I was seeing all over reddit. This is just a small sampling of pure panic comments that had a lot of upvotes. \n\nOf course, hindsight is 20/20 and I wouldn’t be posting this if we never recovered. And I’m not saying we are out of the woods yet or shouldn’t expect another correction. However, something has to be said when the people who champion DCA and time in the market > timing the market completely crumble during a correction. \n\nTwo takeaways:\n- You must have high conviction in your investing strategy. I am a permanent, long term BULL and will always buy and hold. I will only get out of the market if I need emergency money or society as we know it is collapsing (in which case money would be useless anyway).\n- The Reddit (and internet at large) hive mind is real. The sentiment on these subs could not have been lower in April yet here we are, doing alright in my opinion.\n\nWhat do you guys think - anyone guilty of panicking and abandoning their strategy back in April?\n\n",

    "content": "I have been scratching my head as to why the bond/stock market is so resilient given that Federal govt wants to monetize the debt without any regard to value of USD going down(this will lead to loss of reserve currency status).\n\nI was wondering if the elites have lost all influence, I mean, there may be around 3000 people with networth of more than 500 million, they have the maximum to lose if things break down. IMO, they will try to make sure that the current economic/geopolitical system is not dismantled without an idea/plan about the future economic/geopolitical order. It can lead to chaos or hyperinflation or stagflation.\n\nI heard on bloomberg this morning that senate is not going to let the destruction of Fed independence happen. This makes total sense to me since most of them have relationship with  industry leaders and they themselves have a lot to lose if we get economic crash like 2008. Supposedly, senate will make sure a qualified person will be the new Fed governor. I am guessing same applies to next Fed chair.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\n\nBTW, I am not saying that the rich can get away with anything. I am just implying that 99% of people do not have such influence after election is over. IMO, only the top 0.2% have relationship with elected officials.",
